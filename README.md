## UX

When designing this webpage I wanted to achieve a balance of professionalism with a sense of calm and cleanliness.

### Colour Scheme

By choosing the colours below, I hoped to achieve the calm and cleanliness feeling.

- `#FFFFFF` used all throughout the site primarily on text elements.
- `#000000` also used all throughout the site mainly on text and border elements.
- `#87CEEB` used all throughout the site, its main use being a background-color.
- `#0B3D91` used all throughout the site, its uses being: buttons and main elements such as cards.
- `#F8F9FA` used all throughout the site, it is the main background colour for the site.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/87ceeb-0b3d91-000000-f8f9fa-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

```mermaid 
erDiagram
User ||--o{ Pet : fk_User_Pet
User ||--|{ Appointment : fk_User_Appointment
Service ||--|| Appointment : fk_Service_Appointment


    User {
        int id
        varchar(50) first_name
        varchar(50) last_name
        varchar(255) email
        varchar(100) password
        varchar(30) phone_number
        varchar(100) address
        varchar(100) image

    }

    Service {
        int id
        varchar(50) name
        text description
        text short_description
        varchar(100) image
        decimal vary_price1
        decimal vary_price2
    }

    Pet {
        int id
        varchar(255) name
        varchar(50) breed
        int age
        text medical_notes
        int user_id
        varchar(100) image
    }

    Appointment {
        int id
        int user_id
        int service_id
        int pet_id
        int status
        dateTime start_date_time
        text description
    }
    
```

I have used [mermaidchart](https://www.mermaidchart.com/)  to generate an ERD.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues) served as another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues)

    ![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/gh-issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://woof-wash-grooming-b7fa1160192f.herokuapp.com/).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL database's by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
