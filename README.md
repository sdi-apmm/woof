## UX

When designing this webpage I wanted to achieve a balance of professionalism with a sense of calm and cleanliness.

### Colour Scheme

By choosing the colours below, I hoped to achieve the calm and cleanliness feeling.

- `#FFFFFF` used all throughout the site primarily on text elements.
- `#000000` also used all throughout the site mainly on text and border elements.
- `#87CEEB` used all throughout the site, its main use being a background-color.
- `#0B3D91` used all throughout the site, its uses being: buttons and main elements such as cards.
- `#F8F9FA` used all throughout the site, it is the main background colour for the site.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/87ceeb-0b3d91-000000-f8f9fa-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

```mermaid 
erDiagram
User ||--o{ Pet : fk_User_Pet
User ||--|{ Appointment : fk_User_Appointment
Service ||--|| Appointment : fk_Service_Appointment


    User {
        int id
        varchar(50) first_name
        varchar(50) last_name
        varchar(255) email
        varchar(100) password
        varchar(30) phone_number
        varchar(100) address
        varchar(100) image

    }

    Service {
        int id
        varchar(50) name
        text description
        text short_description
        varchar(100) image
        decimal vary_price1
        decimal vary_price2
    }

    Pet {
        int id
        varchar(255) name
        varchar(50) breed
        int age
        text medical_notes
        int user_id
        varchar(100) image
    }

    Appointment {
        int id
        int user_id
        int service_id
        int pet_id
        int status
        dateTime start_date_time
        text description
    }
    
```

I have used [mermaidchart](https://www.mermaidchart.com/)  to generate an ERD.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/kanban-board.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues) served as another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues) [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues)

    ![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/gh-issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming/blob/main/documentation/readme/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://woof-wash-grooming-b7fa1160192f.herokuapp.com/).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL database's by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)

3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Jordan-Boulton1/woof-wash-grooming)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
